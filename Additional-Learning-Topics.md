- **Networking with Retrofit** - API communication
- **Image Loading (Glide/Picasso)** - Efficient image handling
- **Background Tasks** - WorkManager, Services, JobScheduler
- **Custom Views & Canvas Drawing** - Creating custom UI components
- **Animations** - Property animations, transitions
- **Testing** - Unit tests, UI tests with Espresso

### Phase 3 Additions - Modern Development
- **Dependency Injection** - Hilt/Dagger for better architecture
- **Repository Pattern** - Clean architecture principles
- **Use Cases/Interactors** - Business logic separation
- **Error Handling Patterns** - Result/Either types, exception handling
- **Performance Optimization** - Memory leaks, profiling tools
- **Security Best Practices** - Secure storage, network security

### Phase 4 - Advanced Topics (New Phase)
- **Multi-module Architecture** - Scaling large applications
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions, automated testing/deployment
- **App Distribution** - Play Store publishing, signing, versioning
- **Analytics & Crash Reporting** - Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics
- **Push Notifications** - Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Deep Linking** - App navigation from external sources
- **Accessibility** - Making apps usable for everyone
- **Internationalization** - Multi-language support

### Phase 5 - Professional Development (New Phase)
- **Code Review Best Practices** - Writing maintainable code
- **Git Workflow** - Branching strategies, collaboration
- **Documentation** - KDoc, README, architecture decisions
- **Design Patterns** - Observer, Factory, Builder, etc.
- **Clean Code Principles** - SOLID principles, refactoring
- **Performance Monitoring** - APM tools, optimization techniques

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile** - Sharing code between Android/iOS
- **Flutter vs Native** - Understanding trade-offs
- **React Native** - Alternative cross-platform approach

### Industry Tools & Practices
- **Version Control** - Advanced Git techniques
- **Project Management** - Agile, Scrum methodologies
- **API Design** - RESTful services, GraphQL
- **Backend Integration** - Understanding server-side concepts
- **DevOps Basics** - Docker, cloud services, monitoring

## Recommended Learning Order Integration

### Week 1-2: Strengthen Kotlin Foundation
Add scope functions, extension functions, and generics to your current Kotlin phase.

### Week 3-4: Data & Networking
Before moving to UI, add local storage (Room) and networking (Retrofit) concepts.

### Week 5-6: Architecture Patterns
Integrate MVVM, Repository pattern, and dependency injection early.

### Week 7-8: Testing & Quality
Add testing practices throughout your learning, not as an afterthought.

### Week 9-10: Performance & Security
Focus on optimization and security best practices.

### Week 11-12: Professional Skills
Emphasize code quality, documentation, and collaboration tools.
